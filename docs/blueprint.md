## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A gradient from deep blue (#3F51B5) to a vibrant purple (#9C27B0) for a professional yet modern feel.
- Background color: A very light lavender (#E1BEE7) offers a soft, visually appealing backdrop that enhances readability without stark contrast.
- Accent color: Use different shades of violet and purple for key actions, creating an engaging and intuitive experience.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines, for a modern and geometric look, and 'Work Sans' (sans-serif) for body text, for a clean, readable, and elegant aesthetic.
- Employ a set of carefully designed, minimalist line icons with a subtle gradient fill (from the primary to accent colors) to represent different actions, status indicators and report categories, ensuring visual interest and clarity.
- Implement a card-based layout, enhanced with subtle shadows and rounded corners, for displaying lesson schedules and student information to organize content in an intuitive, visually appealing manner.
- Incorporate fluid transitions and micro-interactions on calendar events and when changing student statuses, providing engaging visual feedback that feels both polished and responsive.
